					Having been married for 17 years, divorced, and successfully
					dated again in todayâ€™s complex social environment, and now
					happily married, Marni understands what it feels like to be
					lonely and sick of wasting time going on dates and having
					relationships with unavailable men that go nowhere.
					<br />
					<br />
					Through her own journey to find love, Marni discovered that
					creating a process to shorten the journey for other women
					suffering from the inability to create emotionally safe and
					fulfilling life relationships was truly the mission of her
					soul and purpose.
